        A list of trusted dependencies.

        If a dependency is trusted.
        Run the following scripts in order if present:

        > All versions of a dependency are trusted if there are multiple versions.

        preinstall
        install
        postinstall
        prepublish
        preprepare
        prepare
        postprepare

        The lifecycle scripts run only after node_modules are completely initialized with ALL dependencies.
        Lifecycle scripts can execute arbitrary code. Which makes them potentially insecure.
        They often violate isolation between packages. Which makes them potentially insecure.

        *TODO*:

        Trust all dependencies:

          trustedDeps [ "*" ]

        Trust all dependencies starting with "@org"

          trustedDeps [ "@org/*" ]

        which is usefull if you want to add all dependendencies within an organization.
